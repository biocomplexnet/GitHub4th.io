# Scientific Program & Workshops

While it is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged for every participant to present their scientific projects. This event offers a unique opportunity to share your scientific expertise and connect with like-minded individuals who are interested in your research areas. Engaging in these discussions can enhance your network and potentially lead to collaborative opportunities. Importantly, there is **NO fee to attend/participate** any of the workshops, talks, or other sessions at the event, making it an even more accessible opportunity for all attendees.

We offer two types of talks at the event:

**Light Talk**: Consists of a 10-minute presentation followed by a 5-minute question-and-answer session.
**Keynote Talk** (1 to 2 per day): Features a 25-minute presentation with an additional 5 minutes for questions.
Participants are asked to provide a meaningful (preliminary) title during registration to facilitate the scheduling of talk sessions. To support the presentations, we will provide a video projector equipped with VGA and HDMI ports, as well as a laser pointer.

The preliminary schedule of our scientific program will be announced soon. TBA
